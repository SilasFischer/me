    <h1> Observations from a (1/4) Lifetime </h1>
    <p> Silas Fischer is most comfortable being an observer. The hairs on the back of his neck are hoisted up in defense of their goosebumps at the thought that someone else is watching him. Because of this nervous tendency, having someone write about him is an uncomfortable task, and because of that, this is being written about him, <i> not by him. </i>
    <br/><br/>
    He has attempted to create several creative projects, often overreaching his physical capabilities with grand desires for finalized projects. Those cannot, and will not, be shown here as they predictably have not been finished, <i> yet. </i>
    <br/><br/>
    Instead, below you will find some selected works that do not really have fully formed formal ideas, but are just investigations or practices of media forms. </p>
